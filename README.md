The WordFrequencyComparator is a simple single-page web application for comparaing average word frequencies across folders of documents
in order to facilitate empirical analysis. If the user inputs a URL into the Add Document form, the text of the document will be scraped automatically.

application up and running.

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
